## Background
There is increasing emphasis on proactive student support for educators, which indicates a growing trend in education where institutions prioritise providing early intervention and preventative measures to address potential student challenges rather than reacting to these issues when they arise.

## Motivation
Early prediction of Failure can help institutions intervene before the academic challenges escalate. This project aims to build a predictive model that forecasts studentsâ€™ failing early in the school term to allow early intervention and support for students who are at risk.

## Objectives
The team has declared these objectives for our project:
- Implement and compare multiple machine learning models to predict a student passing or failing.
- Evaluate models using appropriate performance metrics
- Provide actionable insights for educators to intervene early (TBD?)

## Dataset Used
The team utilized the [Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anlgrbz/student-demographics-online-education-dataoulad/data) due to its comprehensive and diverse data. It is a reliably sourced dataset derived from real student interactions rather than synthetically generated data, ensuring authenticity and applicability to real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started
Just download Python Dummy.
